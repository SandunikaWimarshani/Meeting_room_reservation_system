The web-based Meeting Room Reservation System is a user-friendly application that allows users to book conference rooms, manage their schedules and check the availability.  Both admin and users are the 
potential shareholders of this system. The user can view images of the room and detailed information about the venue in the user module and they can add or update records, as well as delete their personal 
information from the reservation details. By selecting user registration, the administrator can manage it for both the user and the system details.  They can review or modify the room's information and they 
have access to information about booked spaces as well.
